## Documentation
This repository contains a few libraries and mods, although the Wiki will only go over the libraries and source code. If you need help as normal player, contact me in my Discord server.

You can also use Github Pages, which has better interface: https://kaibeckers.github.io/subnautica-canary/ (i'm trying to get this to work)
